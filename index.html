        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
    </div>
     <li>Security Concerns</li>
     <p>Storing sensitive data on remote servers managed by third-party providers introduces security risks. While reputable cloud providers invest heavily in security measures, including encryption and access controls, data breaches and cyber attacks remain a concern. Businesses must carefully evaluate the security protocols of their chosen cloud provider and implement additional measures to protect their data</p>
     <li>Dependency on Internet Connectivity</li>
     <p>Cloud computing relies heavily on internet connectivity. If a business experiences an internet outage or slowdown, it may disrupt access to cloud services and applications, impacting productivity. Moreover, latency issues can arise when accessing data or applications hosted on remote servers, particularly for bandwidth-intensive tasks</p>
     <li>Limited Customization and Control</li>
     <p>Cloud services often offer standardized solutions that may not fully meet the specific needs of every business. Customizing cloud-based applications or infrastructure can be challenging, as businesses have limited control over the underlying hardware and software configurations. This lack of customization may restrict certain functionalities or integrations desired by the organization.</p>
     <li>Potential Downtime and Service Outages</li>
     <p>Despite robust infrastructure and redundancy measures, cloud providers may experience downtime or service outages due to technical issues, maintenance activities, or cyber attacks. These disruptions can temporarily disrupt access to critical services and data, impacting business operations and customer satisfaction. Businesses should have contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of cloud service interruptions</p>
     <li>Data Privacy and Compliance Concerns</li>
     <p>Compliance requirements vary across industries and jurisdictions, governing how organizations handle and protect sensitive data. When utilizing cloud services, businesses must ensure compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS. Entrusting third-party providers with data storage and processing introduces complexities in data privacy management and may necessitate legal agreements and audits to ensure compliance.</p>
